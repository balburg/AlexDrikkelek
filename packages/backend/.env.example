NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=info

# CORS Configuration
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000

# Azure SQL Database (Optional)
# If not configured, the backend will use built-in fallback data for style packs and challenges
# For full functionality (custom style packs, persistent data), configure these:
#
# Note: Connection timeout is set to 30 seconds to accommodate Azure SQL Database connections
# If you experience connection timeouts, ensure:
# 1. Azure SQL firewall rules allow connections from your IP address
# 2. Server name, database name, and credentials are correct
# 3. Network connectivity to Azure is stable
DB_SERVER=your-server.database.windows.net
DB_DATABASE=alexdrikkelek
DB_USER=your-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-password
DB_ENCRYPT=true

# Azure Blob Storage
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=your-connection-string
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER=avatars

# Note: Authentication is intentionally disabled - game operates anonymously
# Players join with just a name and avatar (no login required)
# 
# Redis has been removed - the backend runs as a single instance with in-memory state
# Ensure Azure App Service ARR affinity (sticky sessions) is enabled for production
